\chapter{Python Development Environment for Walmart Sales Forecasting}

\section{Python Version}

This project utilizes \textbf{Python 3.12}, the latest stable release published on October 2, 2023 \cite{Box:2016}. Python 3.12 represents a significant advancement in the Python ecosystem, introducing enhanced performance optimizations, improved error messaging, and new language features that make it particularly well-suited for time series forecasting and feature selection applications in the Walmart Sales Forecasting project \cite{Montgomery:2008}.

The selection of Python 3.12 for this project is strategic, aligning with the computational demands of ARIMA modeling and the sophisticated feature engineering requirements outlined in the project manual. This version provides approximately 5\% overall performance improvement compared to its predecessors, which is crucial for processing the extensive Walmart sales dataset containing over 400,000 records across 45 stores and 81 departments \cite{Guyon:2003}.

\section{Description}

Python 3.12 serves as the foundational runtime environment for the Walmart Sales Forecasting project, providing the computational framework necessary for implementing sophisticated time series analysis and machine learning workflows. As an interpreted, high-level programming language, Python 3.12 offers exceptional capabilities for data science applications, particularly in retail forecasting contexts where complex statistical modeling and feature selection methodologies are essential \cite{Montgomery:2008}.

\end{lstlisting}

\section{Configuration}

Proper configuration of the Python 3.12 environment is critical for the Walmart Sales Forecasting project, ensuring reproducible results across development, testing, and production environments. The configuration process establishes isolated virtual environments, manages dependencies, and configures development tools to support the complete forecasting workflow \cite{Montgomery:2008}.

\subsection{Virtual Environment Architecture}

The project employs a sophisticated virtual environment strategy that isolates dependencies while enabling efficient development workflows:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item \textbf{Create Project Virtual Environment:}
	\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash]
	# Navigate to project root directory
	cd walmart_sales_forecasting
		
	# Create virtual environment using Python 3.12
	python3.12 -m venv venv_walmart_forecasting
	\end{lstlisting}
	
	\item \textbf{Environment Activation Procedures:}
	\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash]

\end{description}

\section{First Steps}

The initial steps in the Python 3.12 environment establish the foundation for developing the Walmart Sales Forecasting system. These steps verify the installation, test core functionality, and prepare the environment for time series analysis and machine learning workflows \cite{Box:2016}.

\subsection{Environment Verification}

Before beginning development, comprehensive verification ensures all components function correctly:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=python]
	# test_environment.py - Comprehensive environment verification
	import sys
	import platform
	from datetime import datetime
	
	print("=" * 60)
	print("Walmart Sales Forecasting - Environment Verification")
	print("=" * 60)
	print(f"Timestamp: {datetime.now()}")
	print(f"Python Version: {sys.version}")
	print(f"Platform: {platform.platform()}")
	print(f"Processor: {platform.processor()}")
	print("=" * 60)
	
	# Test core scientific computing stack
	test_packages = [
	('numpy', 'np'),
	('pandas', 'pd'), 
	('matplotlib.pyplot', 'plt'),
	('statsmodels.api', 'sm'),
	('sklearn', 'sklearn'),
	('pmdarima', 'pmdarima')
	]
	
	for package_name, alias in test_packages:
	try:
	module = __import__(package_name, fromlist=[''])
	version = getattr(module, '__version__', 'Unknown')
	print(f" {package_name}: {version}")
	except ImportError as e:
	print(f" {package_name}: {e}")
	
	print("=" * 60)
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{Interactive Python REPL}

The Python REPL provides immediate feedback for testing concepts and exploring data:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash]
	# Launch Python interactive interpreter
	python3.12
	
	# Alternative: Launch with enhanced IPython
	pip install ipython
	ipython
\end{lstlisting}

Once in the REPL, test basic functionality:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=python]
	>>> import pandas as pd
	>>> import numpy as np
	>>> 
	>>> # Test basic data manipulation capabilities
	>>> test_data = pd.DataFrame({
		...     'date': pd.date_range('2023-01-01', periods=10, freq='D'),
		...     'sales': np.random.randn(10) * 100 + 1000
		... })
	>>> 
	>>> print(test_data.head())
	>>> print(f"Data shape: {test_data.shape}")
	>>> print(f"Memory usage: {test_data.memory_usage().sum()} bytes")
\end{lstlisting}

\section{Program "Hello World"}

The traditional "Hello World" program serves as the initial verification of Python functionality, but for the Walmart Sales Forecasting project, we extend this concept to include domain-specific functionality that demonstrates the environment's readiness for time series analysis \cite{Montgomery:2008}.

\subsection{Basic Hello World Implementation}

The fundamental Python program verifies basic interpreter functionality:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=python]
	# hello_world.py - Basic Python verification
	print("Hello, World!")
	print("Welcome to Walmart Sales 
			Forecasting with Python 3.12")
	
	# Verify Python version
	import sys
	print(f"Running on Python {sys.version_info.major}.
			{sys.version_info.minor}.{sys.version_info.micro}")
\end{lstlisting}

Save this as \texttt{hello\_world.py} and execute:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash]
	python hello_world.py
\end{lstlisting}

Expected output:
\begin{verbatim}
	Hello, World!
	Welcome to Walmart Sales Forecasting with Python 3.12
	Running on Python 3.12.8
\end{verbatim}

\section{Conclusion}

Python 3.12 provides a robust, high-performance foundation for the Walmart Sales Forecasting project, offering significant improvements in execution speed, error handling, and language features that directly benefit time series analysis and machine learning workflows. The comprehensive installation and configuration procedures outlined ensure reproducible development environments across team members and deployment targets.

The systematic approach to environment setup, from basic "Hello World" verification through sophisticated forecasting-specific validation, establishes confidence in the development platform's readiness for implementing complex ARIMA models and feature selection methodologies. The integration of virtual environments, dependency management, and modern development tools creates a sustainable foundation for both research and production deployment phases of the project \cite{Box:2016}\cite{Montgomery:2008}\cite{Guyon:2003}.

The workflow diagram and configuration procedures provide a clear roadmap for team members to establish consistent development environments, ensuring that statistical models developed in one environment will produce identical results when deployed in production. This reproducibility is essential for maintaining the integrity and reliability of the Walmart Sales Forecasting system throughout its operational lifecycle.
