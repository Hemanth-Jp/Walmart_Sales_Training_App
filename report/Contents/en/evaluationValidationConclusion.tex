\chapter{Evaluation}

\section{Evaluation Concept}

The Walmart sales forecasting system employs Weighted Mean Absolute Error (WMAE) as the primary evaluation metric, providing both technical accuracy assessment and business-relevant performance interpretation. This evaluation framework prioritizes interpretability and practical applicability over purely statistical measures.

\textbf{WMAE Methodology}: The system calculates both absolute and normalized WMAE, where the normalized version expresses error as a percentage of actual sales values. This dual approach provides concrete understanding of forecast accuracy (\$923.12 weekly absolute error) while enabling performance categorization for business decision-making.

\textbf{Performance Categories}: The evaluation framework employs three distinct performance categories:
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Excellent}: Normalized WMAE < 5\% (high confidence for business planning)
	\item \textbf{Acceptable}: Normalized WMAE 5-15\% (adequate for operational planning)  
	\item \textbf{Poor}: Normalized WMAE > 15\% (requires model optimization)
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Business-Oriented Assessment }: The evaluation approach emphasizes business relevance over purely academic metrics, ensuring that performance measures directly translate to operational value and decision-making confidence.

\section{Application}

\subsection{Evaluation Application}

The WMAE evaluation methodology was systematically applied across the 4,400+ time series dataset, using a temporal 70/30 train-test split that respects time series ordering requirements. This approach ensures realistic evaluation that mirrors actual forecasting scenarios.

\textbf{Temporal Validation }: The evaluation employs walk-forward validation principles where models are trained on historical data (70\%) and evaluated on future periods (30\%), simulating real-world forecasting conditions where future data is unavailable during model development.

\textbf{Cross-Model Comparison }: Both ARIMA and Exponential Smoothing algorithms undergo identical evaluation procedures, enabling objective comparison of forecasting approaches under consistent conditions and performance metrics.

\subsection{System Application}

The forecasting system demonstrates practical applicability through dual-application architecture supporting both technical development and business deployment scenarios.

\textbf{Implementation }: Develop API integration framework supporting multiple data sources with automated feature engineering and selection. Implement streaming data processing for continuous model updates and real-time forecast adjustments.

\textbf{Expected Impact }: Enhanced forecasting accuracy for short-term predictions (1-2 weeks) and improved ability to capture external shock effects on retail sales patterns.

\subsection{Idea 3: Future Research - Hierarchical Forecasting Framework}

\textbf{Concept }: Implement hierarchical forecasting that reconciles predictions across store, department, and regional levels while maintaining consistency and optimizing resource allocation across the organizational hierarchy.

\textbf{Implementation }: Develop bottom-up and top-down reconciliation methods with optimal combination weights determined through cross-validation. Include capacity constraints and business rules in the reconciliation process.

\textbf{Expected Impact }: Improved forecast consistency across organizational levels and enhanced support for strategic planning and resource allocation decisions.

\chapter{Conclusion}

\section{Self-Critical Assessment}

\textbf{Methodological Strengths }: The project successfully demonstrates practical application of time series forecasting in retail environments with excellent performance (3.58\% WMAE) and strong business applicability. The dual-application architecture effectively balances technical sophistication with user accessibility.

\textbf{Technical Limitations }: The approach relies exclusively on traditional statistical methods (ARIMA, Exponential Smoothing) without exploring modern deep learning approaches that might capture more complex patterns. The weekly aggregation level may obscure important daily patterns, and the limited temporal scope (2010-2012) restricts assessment of long-term model stability.

\textbf{Data Constraints }: The dataset represents only 45 stores from Walmart's global network, limiting generalizability. The study lacks comparison with alternative forecasting methods or industry benchmarks, making it difficult to assess relative performance objectively.

\textbf{Implementation Challenges }: Cross-platform deployment proved more complex than anticipated, requiring extensive error handling and fallback mechanisms. Model serialization compatibility issues between development and production environments created unexpected technical debt.

\textbf{User Experience Gaps }: While the system achieves technical objectives, user feedback indicates that business stakeholders require more comprehensive interpretation guidance and uncertainty quantification to fully trust automated forecasts for critical decisions.

\textbf{Academic Rigor }: The project prioritizes practical implementation over theoretical contribution, potentially limiting academic impact. The evaluation framework, while business-relevant, lacks comparison with state-of-the-art forecasting methods from recent literature.
