\section{Frequently Asked Questions}

\subsection{General System Questions}

\subsubsection{Getting Started}

\textbf{Q: Which deployment option should I choose?}\\
\textbf{A:} For quick evaluation and occasional use, choose cloud deployment. For regular use, large datasets, or organizational requirements, choose local installation.

\textbf{Q: Do I need programming experience to use the system?}\\
\textbf{A:} No programming experience is required for basic usage. The web interface handles all technical aspects. However, understanding time series concepts is helpful for interpreting results.

\textbf{Q: How accurate are the forecasts?}\\
\textbf{A:} The default Exponential Smoothing model achieves 3.58\% normalized WMAE, which is considered excellent for business forecasting. Custom models may achieve different accuracy levels depending on data quality and parameters.

\textbf{Q: Can I use this system for non-retail forecasting?}\\
\textbf{A:} While designed for retail sales, the system can potentially work with other time series data that follows similar patterns. However, optimal performance is achieved with sales-type data containing seasonal patterns.

\subsubsection{Data Requirements}

\textbf{Q: What if I don't have all three required CSV files?}\\
\textbf{A:} All three files (train.csv, features.csv, stores.csv) are required for training. If you're missing features or stores data, you can create minimal versions with basic information or use the default models for prediction only.

\textbf{Q: How much historical data do I need?}\\
\textbf{A:} Minimum 2 years of weekly data is recommended for seasonal pattern detection. More data (3-5 years) typically improves model accuracy, especially for capturing seasonal variations.

\textbf{Q: Can I use daily or monthly data instead of weekly?}\\
\textbf{A:} The system is specifically designed for weekly sales data. Using other frequencies would require code modifications and retraining of models.

\subsection{Technical Questions}

\subsubsection{Installation and Setup}

\textbf{Q: Why specifically Python 3.12 and not newer versions?}\\
\textbf{A:} The system was developed and tested with Python 3.12. Package dependencies are validated for this version. Newer Python versions may have compatibility issues with specific package versions.

\textbf{Q: Can I run both applications simultaneously?}\\
\textbf{A:} Yes, the applications are designed to run on different ports (8501 and 8502). This allows simultaneous training and prediction operations.

\textbf{Q: What happens if my local installation stops working?}\\
\textbf{A:} Use the troubleshooting procedures in Chapter 8, particularly the pytest validation tests. As a backup, you can always use the cloud versions while fixing local issues.

\subsubsection{Model and Predictions}

\textbf{Q: Why do I get negative forecast values?}\\
\textbf{A:} Negative values indicate predicted sales decreases from the previous week. This is normal business behavior and doesn't indicate errors. The system forecasts changes, not absolute values.

\textbf{Q: Can I forecast beyond 4 weeks?}\\
\textbf{A:} The current system is optimized for 4-week forecasts. Longer horizons typically require model modifications and retraining for accuracy.

\textbf{Q: How often should I retrain models?}\\
\textbf{A:} Retrain quarterly or when performance degrades. If you notice forecasts becoming less accurate, it's time to retrain with fresh data.

\subsection{Advanced Usage Questions}

\subsubsection{Model Customization}

\textbf{Q: How do I choose between Auto ARIMA and Exponential Smoothing?}\\
\textbf{A:} Exponential Smoothing is generally faster and works well with clear seasonal patterns. Auto ARIMA is more flexible but takes longer to train. Try both and compare WMAE scores.

\textbf{Q: What hyperparameters should I adjust first?}\\
\textbf{A:} For Auto ARIMA, start with max\_p and max\_q values (try 5-10). For Exponential Smoothing, adjust seasonal\_periods to match your business cycle.

\textbf{Q: Can I combine forecasts from multiple models?}\\
\textbf{A:} The current system doesn't support ensemble methods, but you can manually combine forecasts from different models exported as CSV files.

\subsubsection{Data and Performance}

\textbf{Q: My training takes very long. How can I speed it up?}\\
\textbf{A:} Reduce hyperparameter search ranges, use smaller datasets for testing, or switch to Exponential Smoothing. Consider upgrading hardware for large datasets.

\textbf{Q: What's the maximum dataset size I can use?}\\
\textbf{A:} Cloud deployment supports up to 200MB files. Local installation is limited by available RAM. For large datasets, consider data sampling or chunking.
