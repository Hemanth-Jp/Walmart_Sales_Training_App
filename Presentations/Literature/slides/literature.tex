\Mysection{Introduction}

\STANDARD{}
{
	
	Time series analysis and forecasting have become fundamental components of modern data science, with applications spanning from retail sales prediction to financial market analysis. The integration of powerful Python libraries such as pandas, NumPy, statsmodels, and specialized forecasting packages like pmdarima has revolutionized how we approach temporal data analysis.
	
	This literature review examines the current state of time series forecasting methodologies, focusing on ARIMA modeling, exponential smoothing techniques, and the Python ecosystem tools that enable efficient implementation and deployment of forecasting solutions. We explore both theoretical foundations and practical applications, with particular attention to retail forecasting scenarios and modern deployment frameworks.
